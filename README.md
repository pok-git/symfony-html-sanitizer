symfony-html-sanitizer
========================
This a symfony demo to test forms and html sanitization.
In this initial version 
_Sanitizing HTML from Form Input_ 
does not work.
Manual sanitization in the controller works as expected.

Requirements
------------
* Symfony 6.3;
* PHP 8.2 or higher;

Resources
------------
* [Symfony Documentation][1]
* [Symfony html_sanitizer][2]
